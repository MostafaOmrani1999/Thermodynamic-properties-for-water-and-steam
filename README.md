properties is based on IAPWS descriptions and is diffrent from academic textbooks like van wylen or cengel

if temperature was around 1073.15k and more use region 5

if temperature was between 273.15k and 623.15k, using region 4 find saturation pressure for given temperature, if the given pressure was less than saturation pressure use region2, otherwise use region 1

if temperature was between 623.15 and 823.15, using boundary between region 2 and 3 find the pressure, if the given pressure was less than calculated pressure use region 3 otherwise use region 2

if temperature was between 823.15 and 1073.15 use region 3

region 3 is based on temperature and density inputs, so for using this have to guess the value of pressure using the code for it

could'nt find baclward eqaution based on temperature and pressure for region 3, so it is a good idea to find it(didn't think about it)

it's good idea to combine all codes into one, based on given temperature and pressures above(as a matter of fact did'nt have time to do it)
